    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate that there is agreement between CASA and AstroVIPER when calculating imaging weights using Briggs weighting with robust values of [-2, -1.45, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.33, 2].  \n",
    "Three single-field use cases will be considered: single polarization (XX), parallel hands (XX, YY), and full polarization (XX, XY, YX, YY).  \n",

    "This notebook demonstrates only the serial core functions and does not include any parallelization.\n",

    "The same weights are applied to all polarizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Polarization (XX):** Imaging weights are calculated using the XX data weights.  \n",
    "- **Parallel Hands (XX, YY):** Imaging weights are calculated using the average of the XX and YY data weights.  \n",
    "- **Full Polarization (XX, XY, YX, YY):** Imaging weights are calculated using the average of the XX and YY data weights and applied to all polarizations (XX, XY, YX, YY).  \n",
    "  *Note: The XY and YX data weights are ignored.*\n",

    "\n",
    "- `mosweight` has not been implemented yet. This is planned for future work.  \n",
    "- `perchanweightdensity` is always `True`.  \n",
    "- `briggsbwtaper` has not been implemented yet.  \n",
    "- CASA interpolation was changed from *linear* to *nearest*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should we continue handling the weights in the same way as CASA, or should we consider a more sophisticated approach for the full polarization case?  \n",
    "- Are there any function or parameter names we should change?  \n",
    "- Are there missing weighting options that we should demonstrate?  \n",
    "- What interpolation method should be used when data channel frequencies differ from image channel frequencies?  \n",
    "- Should we calculate the weights independently for each execution block or scheduling block?  \n",
    "  *Example: the last full polarization case (`3c286_Band6_5chans_lsrk_compare_weights.ps.zarr`) has three execution blocks from the same scheduling block.*"

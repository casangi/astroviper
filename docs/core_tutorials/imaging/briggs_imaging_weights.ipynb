    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate that there is agreement between CASA and AstroVIPER when calculating imaging weights using Briggs weighting with robust values of [-2, -1.45, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.33, 2].  \n",

    "- **Single Polarization (XX):** Imaging weights are calculated using the XX data weights.  \n",
    "- **Parallel Hands (XX, YY):** Imaging weights are calculated using the average of the XX and YY data weights.  \n",

    "- `mosweight` has not been implemented yet. This is planned for future work.  \n",
    "- `perchanweightdensity` is always `True`.  \n",
    "- `briggsbwtaper` has not been implemented yet.  \n",
    "- CASA interpolation was changed from *linear* to *nearest*.  \n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should we continue handling the weights in the same way as CASA, or should we consider a more sophisticated approach for the full polarization case?  \n",
    "- Are there any function or parameter names we should change?  \n",
    "- Are there missing weighting options that we should demonstrate?  \n",
    "- What interpolation method should be used when data channel frequencies differ from image channel frequencies?  \n",
    "- Should we calculate the weights independently for each execution block or scheduling block?  \n",
    "  *Example: the last full polarization case (`3c286_Band6_5chans_lsrk_compare_weights.ps.zarr`) has three execution blocks from the same scheduling block.*"
